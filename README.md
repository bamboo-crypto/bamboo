Welcome to PandaCoin! 
====================
<image src="https://github.com/mr-pandabear/panda-website/blob/master/site/static/logo.png" width="350"/>
PandaCoin is a minimalist implementation of a layer 1 cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. It is designed with utmost simplicity and user friendliness in mind and is written from the ground up in C++ â€” it isn't yet another re-packaging of existing open-source blockchain code (where's the fun in that?!). 

### Circulation
PandaCoin's are minted by miners who earn a reward of 50 bamboo per block. Mining payments occur up until block 2,000,000 after which miners are compensated purely through transaction fees. This means the total circulation of the currency is limited to 100,000,000 Bamboo.


### Technical Implementation
PandaCoin is written from the ground up in C++. We want the PandaCoin source code to be simple, elegant, and easy to understand. Rather than adding duct-tape to an existing currency, we built PandaCoin from scratch with lots of love. There are a few optimizations that we have made to help further our core objectives:
* Switched encryption scheme from [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) (which is used by ETH & BTC) to [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) -- results in 8x speedup during verification and public keys half the size. 
* Transactions are created uniquely to each blockID
* 10000 transactions per block, 30 second block time

### Getting Started
*Windows*: Only binaries are available for windows they can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/mr-pandabear/panda-coin/files/7709628/win32_release_binaries.zip

- Run keygen.exe, this generates a keys.json file in the same folder as miner.exe, copy this file and keep it safe.
- Run miner.exe, the miner will start running and should indicate that it is loading blocks to solve.

*Mac OSX* build pre-requirements
```
brew install leveldb
brew install cmake
pip3 install conan
```


*Linux* install pre-requirements
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install make  
sudo apt-get -y install cmake  
sudo apt-get -y install automake
sudo apt-get -y install libtool
sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
sudo apt-get -y install libleveldb-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6
sudo pip3 install conan
```

### Building
```
git clone https://github.com/mr-pandabear/panda-coin.git
cd panda-coin
git checkout master
mkdir build
cd build
conan install ..
cd ..
cmake .
```
To compile the miner run the following command:
```
make miner
```
You will also need the keygen app to create a wallet for your miner:
```
make keygen
```

To compile the node server:
```
make server
```

### Usage
Start by generating `keys.json`. Keep a copy of this file -- it contains pub/private keys to the wallet that the miner will mint coins to.
```
./bin/keygen
```

To start mining:
```
./bin/miner
```

To host a node:
```
./bin/server
```
NOTE: you will need to make a folder `~/panda-coin/data` under panda-coin to store the nodes data
